Common problems
---------------

It's always the strings
+++++++++++++++++++++++

Solution: use QR code.


Ongoing concerns
----------------

Data privacy and security
+++++++++++++++++++++++++
Underwhelming response.
Certain features we are adding require good authentication, and there
are lots of legitimate requests for being able to schedule black out
zones during times of the day.  We've added SSL protection to help
people stay secure, and have implemented alternative transports to
help keep certain credentials safer.  There are a few attempts at
adding authentication, but hesitant to quickly bolt something on and
call it secure.
Support volunteers say this rarely comes up.

How to build a better dosing machine
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
A frequent request is for increased, step-wise integration with DIYPs
or similar technologies.

More devices
++++++++++++
Medtronic support.

Accurate reporting
++++++++++++++++++

Adding dialogue to test acceptance/readiness to "donate data."
Need way to submit "events" to FDA, can work on tool to amend/validate
qualified submissions.
