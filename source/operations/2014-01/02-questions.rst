How quickly are changes or problems addressed
---------------------------------------------

In some cases very quickly, in some cases weeks, months, years may be
required to solve a problem.

In the instance where Dexcom released new firmware, we were able to
release a new patch after 3 days.  In other instances, such as adding
other network protocols, or adding devices, it has taken months of
considerable co-ordinated effort.

How is information on updates distributed
-----------------------------------------

* Facebook
* Twitter
* Play store
* ios app store?
