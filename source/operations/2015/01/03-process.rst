General process
---------------
Social media outlet such as Facebook allows users to post comments.
Github is concentration point for all development efforts.  Everything
distributed through master branch is voted by multiple engineers to be
ready for "production."

As release branches are prepared, developers let people who often help
people know to test new releases.  Developers also use the beta and
alpha channels in the Google Play store.  Once we've done some testing
and fixed the most glaring issues, the developers close the release
branch, and merges to master.
