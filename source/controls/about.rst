Who reviews these documents?

Contributors
++++++++++++
As a decentralized and open project, co-ordinating efforts can be
tricky, especially for new members. These documents should help people
get an idea of overall roadmap, and where to look in order to best
contribute their resources and talents.


Support, community, others
++++++++++++++++++++++++++
As reference to new members, and as reminders to old members.  These
serve as a handbook or guide for how to care for the community.  As a
by-product, they also describe what criteria or expectations are
expected from people aiming to help.

As a guidebook or manual, these documents may help point to other
resources people can use to better inform themselves of how Nightscout
works.

Regulators
++++++++++
While we maintain ongoing discussions with regulators at the FDA, the
changes in these documents help us demonstrate compliance while
minimizing effort.
