Nightscout Foundation
#####################

Volunteers created the Nightscout Foundation to curate and sponsor the
activities of the Nightscout project.  While we anticipate most
activity being decentralized in nature, the Foundation is available to
communicate information to support and development channels.

The Foundation sponsors the activities as specified in the
process-controls.
