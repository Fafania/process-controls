Design controls
===============

Design controls are applied continuously throughout the entire
software development lifecycle process.

Discussion of issues relating to design are handled in discusions on
pull requests marked as exploratory, experimental, or design
proposals, as well as in github issues, when issues are marked as
feature request of update request of some kind.

The pull request discussions in particular provide an in depth view of
which design considerations were considered at which point in time, by
who, and for which reasons a decision was made.

Waffle.io can be used to get an aggregate high level overview of all
issues in consideration at all stages of the process.
